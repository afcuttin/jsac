# Parameters to use for the joint simulation
In every scenario:
- the maximum number of available iterations for the decoding and the interference cancellation is 1;
- the maximum number of possible retransmission in case a packet is not acknowledged is 4.
- the maximum number of active sources must not be grater than 10.

The modulation parameters are as follows:
- 8-PSK modulation
- TODO: the FEC code rate is 3/5 (TBC) [Issue: https://github.com/afcuttin/jsac/issues/25]

## Terrestrial uplink (tul) scenario

## Satellite uplink (sul) scenario

## Satellite downlink (sdl) scenario

## Terrestrial downlink (tdl) scenario
